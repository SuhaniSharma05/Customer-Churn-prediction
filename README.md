n**📉 Customer Churn Prediction Project**

**🎯 Problem Statement**

The telecommunications industry faces a major challenge in retaining its customer base. Customer churn — when existing customers stop using a company's services — directly impacts revenue and growth.

The objective of this project is to:

Predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic, service usage, and billing information.

Identify key factors contributing to customer churn, so the business can take proactive steps for customer retention.

**Business Need:**
By accurately predicting churn, the company can:

Target high-risk customers with retention strategies.

Reduce customer loss and improve profitability.

**Customer Churn Prediction**
A complete machine learning project to predict customer churn using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. This project includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Building with Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation

Best Model Selection & Feature Importance Visualization

Interactive Streamlit Web Application


**✅ Tools & Libraries**

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib, streamlit)

Streamlit (for web app interface)

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier (Best Performing Model)




**⚙ Steps to Reproduce**

1️⃣ Setup Environment

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib streamlit pillow

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and checked missing values.

Converted categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Scaled features using StandardScaler.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Pie charts, histograms, and boxplots used to visualize:

Churn distribution

Monthly charges

Tenure

Total charges

Contract type distribution

4️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation

Split data into training and testing sets (80:20).

Applied scaling.

Trained five models with GridSearchCV:

Logistic Regression (Highest accuracy: 80.6%)

KNN

SVM

Decision Tree

Random Forest (Used as best model for deployment despite slightly lower accuracy)


> Note: Logistic Regression had slightly higher test accuracy, but Random Forest was selected for deployment because of better generalization on cross-validation and feature importance visualization.
> 

5️⃣ Feature Importance (Random Forest)

Used Random Forest’s .feature_importances_ to visualize key features:

feature_importance = pd.Series(best_model.feature_importances_, index=x.columns)
feature_importance.sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar')


6️⃣ Cross Validation Results

Cross-Validation Accuracy Mean: 0.7711


7️⃣ Streamlit Web App

Run the app:

streamlit run app.py

💻 Features:

User input fields for required customer details.

Live churn prediction result.

Customer input summary.

Display of custom image/banner.


**🖼 App Preview**



**📊 Model Performance Summary**

Model	Accuracy

Logistic Regression	80.62%
KNN	78.50%
SVM	79.99%
Decision Tree	78.85%
Random Forest	77.00%


**💡 Future Improvements**

Incorporate more features in the model.

Add SHAP or LIME explanations for model interpretability.

Deploy using Streamlit Cloud or AWS EC2.

Enhance UI/UX design.



**📌 Key Findings** 

1️⃣ Churn Distribution

Around 26–27% of customers in the dataset are churned customers.

Imbalanced but not extremely skewed → handled without specific balancing techniques in your project.


2️⃣ Important Features Identified (From Random Forest Feature Importance)

Top factors influencing churn prediction:

Tenure: Lower tenure values are associated with higher churn risk.

Monthly Charges: Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

Paperless Billing: Customers opting for paperless billing show slightly higher churn probability.

Partner & Dependents: Customers without a partner or dependents show higher churn rates.


3️⃣ Model Performance Observations

Logistic Regression gave the highest accuracy on test data: 80.6%.

Random Forest was chosen as the deployment model because:

It provides feature importance insights.

Slightly more stable performance across cross-validation folds.


Cross-validation score: 77.11% → Indicates reasonable model generalization.


4️⃣ Customer Behavior Patterns (From EDA)

Customers with Month-to-Month contracts show much higher churn probability than those with one-year or two-year contracts.

Total Charges distribution indicates many customers are newer (lower total charges), linking to higher churn in early months.


5️⃣ Business Value Insight

By predicting churn with ~77–80% accuracy, the business can:

Identify high-risk customers early.

Create retention campaigns targeted at customers with lower tenure and higher monthly charges.

Offer discounts or incentives specifically to customers showing churn patterns.
